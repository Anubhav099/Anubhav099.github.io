# Game-Review-Management-System
The "Game Review Management System" is a Python-Flask and HTML/CSS web app that uses MySQL for database management. With user authentication and authorization, it allows players to access up-to-date video game reviews to make informed decisions. Completed during my 3rd yr of eng., it showcases my web development and database management skills.
